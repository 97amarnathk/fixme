      "Hi, in the old system it seemed like there was a protection to prevent a user to record himself on the same sentence multiple times, but with the new interface I have been asked multiple times to record a sentence I already did a few minutes before.\r\n\r\nI think that can be problematic for the quality of the dataset as : \r\n- Multiple clips with the same voice on the same sentence can lead to overfit and brings less informations on how to pronounce than if it was recorded by someone else.\r\n- I guess you collect X records for each sentence, which mean if I'm recorded 3 or 4 times on the same sentence, my voice will represent a higher percentage of that sentence recordings which leads to a lack diversity.\r\n\r\nI wonder if being recorded multiple times on the same sentence is intended and if so I am curious to understand why.\r\n\r\nHave a good day,\r\nLuc.\r\n\r\n",
